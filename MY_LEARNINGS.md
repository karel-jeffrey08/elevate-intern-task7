# My Learnings from Task 7

- I learned how to create a database from scratch using Python's `sqlite3` library.
- I got practice writing a real SQL query with `GROUP BY` and `SUM`.
- Figured out how to run that SQL query inside a Python script and get the data out.
- Used pandas to hold the data that came back from the database.
- Learned how to take the data from pandas and plot it with matplotlib to create a bar chart.
- It helped me understand the full process: creating data, analyzing it, and then showing the results visually.
