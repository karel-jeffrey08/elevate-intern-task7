# Task 7 - Sales Summary

This project is for Task 7 of my internship.

It's a simple Python script that makes a small sales database using SQLite. Then, it pulls data from that database to figure out the total sales for each product.

Finally, it prints out a summary and makes a bar chart to show the results. It was a good exercise to connect Python with a database and show the output in a simple chart.
